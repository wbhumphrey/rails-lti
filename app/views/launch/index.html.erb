<body>
<p>Hi, <%= @username %>, this is an LTI tool. I hope you learned a lot.</p>
<% if @tp.instructor? %>
  <p>You are a teacher, so you could configure this tool now if it were cool enough to have configurations.</p>
  <p>If you come back as a student you may get to take a test.</p>
<% elsif @tp.student? %>
  <p>You're lucky this isn't an assessment launch, you just get to sit here and do nothing.</p>
<% elsif @tp.roles && @tp.roles.any? %>
  <p>Your roles are <%= @tp.roles.join(",") %></p>
<% else %>
  <p>You don't have a role so I don't know what to do with you.</p>
<% end %>

<p>  Here are the params that were passed to the tool: </p>

<p>
  <% params.each do |k,v| %>
    <b><%= k %>:</b> <%= v%><br>
  <% end %>
</p>
